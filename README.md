## Summary
With over 18+ years of experience in IT, I specialize in DevOps Engineering, Platform Engineering, cloud-native technologies, and full-stack development across various domains including Transportation & Logistic, Master Data Management System (MDM) and Financing.

### Day-to-Day Responsibilities

In my daily work, I am primarily engaged in:
- Applying **Generative AI (GenAI)** to automate DevOps workflows and enhance the software development lifecycle.
- **Infrastructure Design** and **Provisioning**, ensuring scalable and secure cloud-native environments.
- Performing a broad range of **DevOps activities**, from automation to deployment.
- Designing and implementing robust **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Practicing **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** to improve system reliability and performance.
- Driving **Platform Engineering** initiatives for developer enablement and infrastructure abstraction.
- Full-stack **Software Development**, with deep expertise in Java and the Spring ecosystem.
- Developing both **microservices** and **monolithic** applications.
- Contributing to **frontend development** with modern JavaScript frameworks.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Expert in designing and provisioning infrastructure using tools like Terraform and Pulumi.
- **CI/CD Pipeline as Code**: Building and managing pipelines with Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Argo CD.
- **Cloud-Native Technologies**: Proficient with Docker, Kubernetes, and Serverless platforms for efficient application delivery.
- **Kubernetes Administration**: Skilled in managing Kubernetes clusters across EKS, AKS, GKE, and on-premises, including RBAC integration and Operator lifecycle management.
- **Self-Service Tooling**: Developing tools for:
    - Kafka producer/consumer onboarding,
    - Centralized performance testing,
    - Role-based access (RBAC) automation across Azure, AWS, and GCP.
- **Backend Development**: Building microservices and monoliths using:
    - Java (Spring Boot with MVC, WebFlux, Security, Integration, Data),
    - Kotlin, Go, Python, and Node.js (with Express).
- **Frontend Development**: Creating SPAs using Vue.js, React.js, and AngularJS.
- **Spring Boot Ecosystem**: Deep expertise in the full Spring Boot stack for web applications and APIs: Spring Data, MVC, WebFlux, Security, and more.
- **Agentic Workflows with GenAI**:
    - Designing intelligent agents and workflows that automate infrastructure provisioning,
    - Streamlining DevOps tasks,
    - Developing GenAI-powered chatbots and autonomous agents.
