## Summary
With over 15+ years in IT, I specialize in DevOps Engineering, Cloud-Native Platforms, and Full-Stack Development across domains like Transportation & Logistics, Master Data Management (MDM), and Finance. My work bridges the gap between infrastructure and software engineering, enabling scalable, secure, and automated solutions.

Day-to-day, I focus on infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) while also developing full-stack applications using Java, Go, Python, and modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue). I’m passionate about Platform Engineering, creating self-service tooling that empowers developers and accelerates delivery.

Utilizing Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities to optimize DevOps workflows, automate infrastructure provisioning, and build intelligent agent-based solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency across the software development lifecycle.

### Areas of Expertise

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Expert in designing and provisioning infrastructure using tools like Terraform and Pulumi.
- **CI/CD Pipeline as Code**: Building and managing pipelines with Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Argo CD.
- **Cloud-Native Technologies**: Proficient with Docker, Kubernetes, and Serverless platforms for efficient application delivery.
- **Kubernetes Administration**: Skilled in managing Kubernetes clusters across EKS, AKS, GKE, and on-premises, including RBAC integration and Operator lifecycle management.
- **Self-Service Tooling**: Developing tools for:
    - Kafka producer/consumer onboarding,
    - Centralized performance testing,
    - Role-based access (RBAC) automation across Azure, AWS, and GCP.
- **Backend Development**: Building microservices and monoliths using:
    - Java (Spring Boot with MVC, WebFlux, Security, Integration, Data),
    - Kotlin, Go, Python, and Node.js (with Express).
- **Frontend Development**: Creating SPAs using Vue.js, React.js, and AngularJS.
- **Spring Boot Ecosystem**: Deep expertise in the full Spring Boot stack for web applications and APIs: Spring Data, MVC, WebFlux, Security, and more.
- **Agentic Workflows with GenAI**:
    - Designing intelligent agents and workflows that automate infrastructure provisioning,
    - Streamlining DevOps tasks,
    - Developing GenAI-powered chatbots and autonomous agents.
- **API Development**: Designing and implementing RESTful and GraphQL APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, API Gateway integration (Apigee, Kong, Azure API Management), and best practices for security, scalability, and versioning.  

- **Event Development**: Architecting and implementing event-driven systems using Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and cloud-native event services (AWS EventBridge, Azure Event Grid, GCP Pub/Sub) for real-time data processing and microservices orchestration.  

- **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**: Implementing SSL/TLS certificates, managing certificate authorities, automating certificate issuance/renewal (Let’s Encrypt, Certbot, ACME), and securing internal/external services with mTLS and PKCS standards.  

- **DNS & CDN Management**: Experienced in managing DNS zones, records, and delegations across Azure DNS, Route53; optimizing performance and security with CDN platforms like Akamai, and Azure Front Door.
