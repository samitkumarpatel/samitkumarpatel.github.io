### Local Development
* Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
* Clone down your fork git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
* Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
* View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
* Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
