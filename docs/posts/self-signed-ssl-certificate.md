title: Self signed ssl certificate witn nginx

**Create a self-signed certificate**

To set up Nginx as an SSL provider, you need an SSL certificate. This article shows how to create and set up a self-signed SSL certificate. For production scenarios, you should obtain a certificate from a certificate authority.

To create a self-signed SSL certificate, use the OpenSSL tool available in Azure Cloud Shell and many Linux distributions, or use a comparable client tool in your operating system.

First create a certificate request (.csr file) in a local working directory:

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ssl.key -out ssl.csr
```
Follow the prompts to add the identification information. For Common Name, enter the hostname associated with the certificate. When prompted for a password, press Enter without typing, to skip adding a password.

Run the following command to create the self-signed certificate (.crt file) from the certificate request. For example:

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ssl.csr -signkey ssl.key -out ssl.crt
```
You should now see three files in the directory: the certificate request (ssl.csr), the private key (ssl.key), and the self-signed certificate (ssl.crt). You use ssl.key and ssl.crt in later steps.

**Configure Nginx to use SSL**

Create Nginx configuration file

In this section, you create a configuration file for Nginx to use SSL. Start by copying the following text into a new file namednginx.conf. In Azure Cloud Shell, you can use Visual Studio Code to create the file in your working directory:

`code nginx.conf`

```
# nginx Configuration File
# https://wiki.nginx.org/Configuration

# Run as a less privileged user for security reasons.
user nginx;

worker_processes auto;

events {
  worker_connections 1024;
}

pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

http {

    #Redirect to https, using 307 instead of 301 to preserve post data

    server {
        listen [::]:443 ssl;
        listen 443 ssl;

        server_name localhost;

        # Protect against the BEAST attack by not using SSLv3 at all. If you need to support older browsers (IE6) you may need to add
        # SSLv3 to the list of protocols below.
        ssl_protocols              TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

        # Ciphers set to best allow protection from Beast, while providing forwarding secrecy, as defined by Mozilla - https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Nginx
        ssl_ciphers                ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA:AES128:AES256:RC4-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

        # Optimize SSL by caching session parameters for 10 minutes. This cuts down on the number of expensive SSL handshakes.
        # The handshake is the most CPU-intensive operation, and by default it is re-negotiated on every new/parallel connection.
        # By enabling a cache (of type "shared between all Nginx workers"), we tell the client to re-use the already negotiated state.
        # Further optimization can be achieved by raising keepalive_timeout, but that shouldn't be done unless you serve primarily HTTPS.
        ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:10m; # a 1mb cache can hold about 4000 sessions, so we can hold 40000 sessions
        ssl_session_timeout  24h;


        # Use a higher keepalive timeout to reduce the need for repeated handshakes
        keepalive_timeout 300; # up from 75 secs default

        # remember the certificate for a year and automatically connect to HTTPS
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains';

        ssl_certificate      /etc/nginx/ssl.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  /etc/nginx/ssl.key;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:80; # TODO: replace port if app listens on port other than 80
            
            proxy_set_header Connection "";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        }
    }
}
```
**Base64-encode secrets and configuration file**
Base64-encode the Nginx configuration file, the SSL certificate, and the SSL key. In the next section, you enter the encoded contents in a YAML file used to deploy the container group.

```
cat nginx.conf | base64 -w 0 > base64-nginx.conf
cat ssl.crt | base64 -w 0 > base64-ssl.crt
cat ssl.key | base64 -w 0 > base64-ssl.key
```
